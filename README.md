# driving-in-the-dark
## This is the Ardour DAW file for the song "Driving in the dark" by Lorenzo's Music.

This is a song recorded by the creative commons band [Lorenzo's Music](https://www.lorenzosmusic.com) using only open-source tools and software.

We use the free and open source [Linux](https://www.linux.org/) based operating system [Ubuntu Studio](https://ubuntustudio.org/). The Ubuntu studio OS has programs and plug-ins for this project preinstalled and ready to use.

The song is recorded with [Ardour](https://ardour.org/) an open-source digital audio workstation.

Most of the effects used come from the open-source audio effects software projects [Calf Studio Gear](https://calf-studio-gear.org/) or [Guitarix virtual guitar amplifier plugins](https://guitarix.org/).

We use Github for the working Ardour files of our songs to collaborate, make changes and record our parts outside of the studio.
